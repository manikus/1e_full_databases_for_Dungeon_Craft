// The line above **must** be the first line of the races file!!! "// Race database file"
//
// name (text)
//	Names should not conflict with any of the names in the
//	baseclass database, class database, items database, spells
//	database, or abilities database, all baseclasses start
//	with a lower case letter and classes with an upper case letter.
//	eg:		name = Human
//
// wieght (equation or integer)
//	Keyword weight lists the weight in pounds of the character
//	eg:		weight = 6d10+100+40*Male
//
// height (equation or integer)
//	Keyword height lists the height in inches of the character
//	eg:		height = 2d10+59+1*Male
//
// age (equation or integer)
//	Keyword age is the character's starting age
//	eg:		age = 1d10+80+1*Male
//
// maxage (equation or integer)
//	Keyword maxage is the maximum age that the character can reach
//	eg:		maxage = 1d100 + 450
//
// BaseMovement (integer)
//	BaseMovement is the distance a character of this race can
//	move during combat while unencumbered.
//	eg:		BaseMovement = 6
//
// AbilityRequirement (ability name, min/max)
//	AbilityRequirement lists the ability name and the
//	minimum and maximum numbers for the ability.
//	One ability per instance of hte keyword.
//	eg:		AbilityRequirement = Strength 8/18(99)
//
// AllowedMultiClass (class name)
//	AllowedMultiClass lists the class name for each of the
//	allowed multi-classes for the race.
//	One multi-class per instance of the keyword.
//	eg:		AllowedMultiClass = Fighter/Thief
//
// Special Ability (special ability name)
//	Each Special Ability corresponds to the Special Ability
//	database and list the name and parameter.
//	One Special Ability per instance of the keyword, which
//	may be listed multiple times.
//	eg:		Special Ability = race_Infravision,60
//
// ChangeClass (yes/no)
//	The ChangeClass keyword determines if a character
//	of this race may change classes.
//	eg:		//ChangeClass = no
//
// DwarfResistance (yes/no)
//	Determines if the character of this race gets the Dwarf Resistance adjustments.
//	Adjustments are to AC and HAC0 against monsters that have the penalty
//	of Dwarf AC and/or Dwarf THAC0
//	Cumulative with GnomeResistance
//	eg:		DwarfResistance = yes
//
// GnomeResistance (yes/no)
//	Determines if the character of this race gets the Gnome Resistance adjustments.
//	Adjustments are to AC and HAC0 against monsters that have the penalty
//	of Gnome AC and/or Gnome THAC0
//	Cumulative with DwarfResistance
//	eg:		GnomeResistance = no
//
// FindSecretDoor (integer)
//	This keyword determines the chance of success of
//	finding a secret door that a character of this
//	race has.
//	Values are the number needed for a 6-sided die
//	eg:		FindSecretDoor = 0
//
// FindSecretDoorSearching (integer)
//	This keyword determines the chance of success of
//	finding a secret door that a character of this
//	race has while searching.
//	Values are the number needed for a 6-sided die
//	eg:		FindSecretDoorSearching = 0

// Skill (text)
// Skills consist of the skill name and the score
//	Eg:	Skill = DetectGrade,75
//
// SkillAdjAbility (skill name,ability name, mod, num1-num25)
//	SkillAdjAbility allows modification of a skill based upon
//	an ability. Name, ability, type of modifier, score
//	modifier for each of the 25 ability scores
//	eg:		SkillAdjAbility = Read,Intelligence,%,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,85,90,95,100,100,100,100,100,105,110,115,115,115,115,115,115,115
//
// SkillAdjRace (skill name, race name, mod, value)
//	SkillAdjRace allows modification of skills per each
//	race, by listing the name of the skill, name of the
//	race, percentage sign and number to modify it by
//	eg:		SkillAdjRace = MaxLevel$SYS$,Half-Elf,\=,5
//
//	*****Notes*****
// Adjustments are of the form:
//    +/-n*(characteristic-k)/d
// For example to adjust, say, height.  Any of these are legal and equivalent.
//		height  =  +1*(Level-0)/1  ; Means (+1*(level-0))/1
//		height  =   1*(Level-0)/1
//		height  =   1*level/1
//		height  =   level/1
//		height  =   1*level
//		height  =   level
// Division throws remainder away.  +1/2 = 0   -1/2 = 0
//
// To suppress a race name at time of Character Creation, remove the "//" from:
// // Special Ability = class_RaceSuppress,"Y"
// in each Race as desired.
