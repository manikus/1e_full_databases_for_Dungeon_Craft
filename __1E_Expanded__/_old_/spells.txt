// Spell database file
// The line above **must** be the first line of the spells file!!!
//
//	Total validation is performed when reading this data. Nothing you do can cause the program to crash.  It may spit error messages and quit for lack of something decent to do but it will not crash or do unexpected things. It shouldn't anyway. If it does, please let us know.
//
//	The first item has the name "template" and will be ignored.  You can use it as a 'template'.  Copy it to the bottom of the file and edit the copy to add your item to the database.
//
//	Each line is of the form    name = value (value may be omitted)
//	eg:   
//		Special Ability = 
//	This line will be interpreted as setting 'Special Ability' to the empty string.  This is commonly the default so in many cases it is the same as omitting the line entirely.
//
//	White space is a bit important.  Because names and values can contain blanks.  So the rule is....leading and trailing whitespace are ignored.  So, for example:
//		attack bonus         =     3         <cr>
//		attack bonus=3<cr>
//	are equivalent.  But
//		attack    bonus = 3
//		attack bonus = 3
//	are different.
//
//	Lines starting with two slashes are comment lines.  Like this one.
//
//	Attribute names are case-insensitive.  
//		Name = Wimpy Axe
//		namE = Wimpy Axe
//		NAME = Wimpy Axe
//	are equivalent.
//	Text values retain their case.  Values with enumerated possibilities are case-insensitive.  Example  cLaSs = PaLaDiN     + FiGhTeR+ThIeF
//
//	File names can use the UNIX syntax with slashes because the backslash is used to escape special characters and it gets ugly to put double backslashes everywhere.  If you like to use backslashes you may. We will accept either.  Even mixed in a single filename.
//	Example:    C:/UAF\\src\\guild of ravens/release1/beta\\art/barkeep.bmp
//
//	Item definitions are delimited by \(BEGIN) ........ \(END) which must start in column 1.  This ain't free format. You get what you pay for.  
//
//  ************ Now for the interesting part  ***********
//
//	Each spell is defined by the following fields:
//
//	Name (text, required)
//	Each spell must have a uniue name.  You may add a qualifier to a name (separated with a vertical bar) to make it unique.  For example:
//		Dimwittify
//		Dimwittify|sorta
//		Dimwittify|really
//
//	The qualifier is only used when editing a design.  The qualifier is discarded when the binary files for the design are created. But the unique name is necessary during the design stage to allow unambiguous references to the spells.  During gameplay they are identified by a binary integer 'key' so there is no confusion between the three Dimwittifies even though they are all printed as 'Dimwittify'.
//	default = all blanks (which makes the entire spell a comment)
//	eg:
//		name = subliminal flash
//
//	Cast Msg (text)
//	This is the text displayed when the spell is cast. You can substitute the names of the target, caster, and spell by using /t, /c, and /s
//	default = none
//	eg:
//		/c blasts /t with /s
//
//	Casting sound (file name, or "none", or "Default")

// The following example creates a spell that can only be cast by clerics and rangers. Also, 'school = Cleric' should preceed this.

//    Script1 = optional, A GPDL script that is evaluated at runtime to determine if

//    Script2 = optional, A GPDL script that is evaluated at runtime to determine how

//    Script3 = optional, A GPDL script that is evaluated at runtime to determine how
//              the saving throw of the spell target is modified based on current game data
//    Script4 = optional, A GPDL script that is evaluated at runtime - but only if the spell target
//              failed the saving throw.
//
//    Scripts are optional and can be left blank. However, if Script3 is used and the others
//    are not, placeholder commas must be used.
// Examples:
//  spell effect = $CHAR_AC, 1d4+2, delta, target, yes
