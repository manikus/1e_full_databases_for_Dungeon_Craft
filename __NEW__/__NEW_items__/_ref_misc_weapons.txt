MISCELLANEOUS WEAPONS (I1I.H.)

The various items listed generally have their bonus applied to both "to hit"
and damage dice, whether it is +1, f 2 , +3, or +4. Any miscellaneous
weapon which is not totally self-explanatory is detailed in one of the
special paragraphs below:

Magic arrows which miss their target are 50% likely to be broken or otherwise
rendered useless. All which hit are destroyed.

Arrow of Slaying is a +3 arrow with some unusual characteristics - a
shaft of some special material, feathers of some rare creature, a head of
strange design, a rune carved on the nock, etc. - which will distinguish it
as fell against some creature type. If the arrow is employed against the
kind of creature it has been enchanted to slay, the missile will kill it
instantly if it hits the target creature. The following list comprises only a
portion of the possible kinds of these arrows:
1) arachnids	9) elementals		17) monks
2) avians		10) fighters		18) paladins
3) bards		11) giants			19) rangers
4) clerics		12) golems			20) reptiles
5) demons		13) illusionists	21) sea monsters
6) devils		14) ki-rin			22) thieves
7) dragons		15) magic-users		23) titans
8) druids		16) mammals			24) undead
Develop your own types and modify and/or limit the foregoing as fits your
campaign.

Axes (hand, not battle) can be thrown up to 3" with the hit probability
bonus, but no damage bonus.

Axe +2, throwing, is a hand axe which can be thrown up to 6" at the
same hit probability as if it were swung by the character, and the standard
damage bonus.

Bow + 1 gives + 1 "to hit" and + 1 damage potential to arrows fired from
it. If magic arrows are used, the bonus is the total of the bow's and the
arrows'. The type of bow found should be based on the circumstances of
your campaign, i.e. composite, short, long, etc. according to the nature of
the area.

Crossbow of accuracy, +3, gives a +3 bonus to its missiles and all ranges
are considered ahort. 10% of these weapons will be heavy crossbows.
Crossbow of Distance has double range in a11 categories. 10% of these
weapons will be heavy crossbows. It is otherwise +1 "to hit" and for
damage.

Crossbow of speed allows its possessor to double the rate of fire normal
for the weapon. If it is grasped, the crossbow of speed will automatically
cock itself. In surprise situations it is of no help, but in complete surprise
situations the held crossbow will enable its user to fire in the 2nd segment
portion. Otherwise, it allows first fire in any melee round, and end of
round fire also, when applicable. 10% of these weapons are heavy crossbows.
The weapon has a + 1 bonus.

Dagger of Venom appears to be a standard + 1 type of dagger, but its hilt
holds a hidden store of poison. Any hit on a score of 20 injects fatal poison
into the opponent unless a saving throw versus poison is successful. The
dagger of venom holds 6 doses of poison, and more can be poured within
when less than that amount is within the hilt. (Use of this weapon by good
- particularly lawful good - characters must be carefully monitored.)

Hammer +3, dwarven thrower appears to be a standard +2 hammer;
but, if in the hands of a dwarven fighter, and a special command word is
spoken, its full potential is realized. The +3 bonus is gained and the following
characteristics: The hammer has a 6" range and it will return to its
wielder's hand in much the same manner as a boomerang would. It has
+3 bonus "to hit" and on damage. When so hurled, the hammer does
double damage against a11 opponents save giants (including ogres, ogre
magi, trolls and ettins), against which it causes triple damage (plus bonus
Of 3).

Hammer of Thunderbolts appears to be a regular hammer of largish size
and extra weight. It will be toa imbalanced, somehow, to wield properly in
combat, unless the character has 18/01 or better strength and a height of
over 6'. The hammer then functions as +3 and gains double damage dice
an any hit. If the wielder wears any girdle of giant strength and gauntlets
of ogre power in addition, he or she may properly wield the weapon if the
hammer's true name is known. When swung or hurled it gains a +5,
double damage dice, all girdle and gauntlets bonuses, and strikes dead
any giant' upon which it scores a hit. When hurled and successfully hitting,
a great noise as if a clap of thunder broke overhead will resound, stunning
all creotures within 3” for 1 round. Throwing range is 1” + %”/point of
strength bonus for the gauntlets and girdle, i.e. 6 + 7 to 12 = 13 to 18 X
%” = 6%”, 7”, 7%”, 8‘, 8%”, 9”. (Thor would throw the hammer obout
double the above ranges . . . ). The hammer of thunderbolts is very difficult
to hurl, so only 1 throw every other round can be mode, and after 5
throws within the spoce of any 2 turn period, the wielder must rest for 1
turn.
* Depending on your campaign, you might wish to limit the effect to
exclude storm giants and include ogres, ogre magi, trolls, ettins, and
clay, flesh, and stone golems.
hammers can be hurled iust os hand axes are.

Mace of Disruption appears to be a + 1 mace, but it has a neutral good
alignment, and ony evil character touching it will take 5-20 points of
damage due to the powerful enchantments loid upon the weapon. If a
mace of disruption strikes any undead creature or evil creature from one
of the lower planes it functions similarly to a cleric turning undead (see
AlTACK MATRICES). The mace causes such creatures to roll on matrix Ill.,
MATRIX FOR CLERICS AFFECTING UNDEAD, as if the wielder were 12th
level, and if the creature struck scores equal to or below the number
shown, it is disrupted and slain. Thus, skeletons, zombies, ghouls,
shadows, and wights are instantly blasted out of existence, as ore ghosts
and even wraiths; and mummies have only a 20% chance, spectres 35%,
vampires 50%, ghosts 65%, liches 80%, and other affected evil creatures
95% chance of soving. Even if these saving throws are effective, the moce
of disruption scores double damage upon opponents of this sort, i.e., 2 X
bonus and 2 X dice.

Scimitar +2 is optionally treated the same as a magic sword - especially
if your campaign is Asian in flavor or the activity area borders near such a
notion. The possibilities are then rolled as follows:
	01 -45 scimitar + 1
	46-65 scimitar +2
	66-80 scimitar +3
	81 -90 scimitar +4
	91 -95 scimitar +5
	96-98 scimitar of wounding
	99-00 scimitar of sharpness
Then roll for unusual characteristics as usual.

Sling of seeking +2 gives its user a +2 bonus for both “to hit” and
damage dice, but missiles from such a weapon are only regarded os +1
with respect to determination of whether or not certain creatures are
affected by the weapon, i.e. o special defense of ”+2 or better weapon to
hit“ meons the creature is impervious to normal missiles from this sling.
Spears can be used as hand or missile weapons. In the latter employment
they might be broken by any creature with 18/00 or greater strength or
against or by one that is massive, i.e. cave bear, hippo, rhino, etc. Intelligent
creatures will be 70% likely to use the hurled spear against the hurler
if struck by the weapon, 25% likely to break it (the spear must save versus
crushing blow). Unintelligent creatures will be 25% likely to break it (save
as above).

Spear, Cursed Backbiter, is to a11 tests a magic spear with o + 1 bonus (or
at your option +2 or +3). Even when it is used in combat against a deadly
enemy it will possibly perform properly, but each time it is used in melee
in anger against a foe, there is a 5% (1 in 20) cumulative chance that it will
function ogainst its wielder, and once so functioning it cannot be loosed
without a remove curse spell. When functioning, the spear will curl to
strike its wielder in the bock, having a hit probability which negates any
shield and/or dexterity bonuses to armor closs, and doing normal
damage. Bockbiting includes hurling, but if the wielder has hurled the
spear, he or she is, of course, loosed from grasping it; the damage done to
the hurler will be double, however.

Trident (military fork) +3 is a short-hafted weapon about 6’ length
overall. Upon command, the middle tine of the trident will retract into the
pole while the shaft of the weapon lengthens to 9’, thus creating a military
fork with a short center spike. The changing of the form of the weapon
from trident to fork or vice verso requires 1 round.

MISCELLANEOUS WEAPONS (lll.H.2.)

Axe of Hurling appears to be a normal hand axe. With familiarity and
practice, however, the possessor will eventually discover that the axe
can be hurled up to 6”distance, and it will return to the thrower in the
same round whether or not it scores a hit. Damage inflicted by the
magical throwing attack is twice normal (2-12v s. S or M, 2-8v s. L),
with the weapon’s magic bonus added thereafter; for instance, an axe
of hurling + 3 will do 5-1 5 points of damage vs. S or M sized creatures
and 5-1 1 points of damage vs. creatures of size L if it hits the target after
being thrown. The same axe will do only normal damage (plus its
magic bonus) when used as a hand-held weapon. After each week of
using the weapon, the possessor has a 121/~c%h ance of discovering
the full properties of the weapon (roll pf 1 on d8). In any event, the
magical properties of the weapon will be fully known to the possessor
after 8 full weeks of such familiarization. The magical bonus of an axe
ofhurling is determined by rolling d20 and referring to the table below.
The experience-point value of such an item is 1,500 x.p. per each
point of magical bonus, and the gold piece sale value is 15,000 gp per
point of bonus.
Die Roll Magic Bonus
1-5 + 1
6-10 +2
11 -15 +3
16- 19 +4
20 +5

Bullet, Sling, of Impact originally appears to be little more than a
well-cast sling bullet. Close examination will reveal minute runes engraved
upon these missiles, and they radiate an aura of enchantment.
Composed of a mixed iron, silver, and lead alloy, each bullet is
equal to a + 1 missile for purposes of “to hit” determination only.
Thus, if one of these missiles is launched from a + 2 magic sling, the
total chance to hit would be + 3, or equal to a + 3 magic weapon, but
damage is determined exclusive of this + 3 bonus. The unadjusted
score to hit is the base determinant of whether additional damage is
done by one of these missiles. That is, if one of these bullets impacts
its target, the sling-user’s base chance to hit (exclusive of magical bonuses)
must be determined. For example, assume that the target
could be hit normally on a 12 or better. If the die score to hit, without
adjustment for any bonus for the sling used or for the bullet itself, is
above the minimum required to hit, then the missile does 2 additional
points of damage for each point of difference between the die roll and
the minimum required to hit. A die score of 13 in this example indicates
+ 2 to damage, a roll of 14 would add + 4, a roll of 15 indicates
+ 6, and so on, while a die roll of 12 or less means that no extra damage
is scored on that hit. The extra damage (if such applies) is added
to the base damage figure (2-92-7fo)r a sling bullet.

Dagger + 2, Longtooth appears to be a normal weapon, or perhaps
a magical weapon of the standard (non-special) sort. However, when
this broad-bladed weapon is wielded by a small demi-human (gnome
or halfling), it will actually lengthen and function as a short sword as
its wielder strikes blows (retaining its + 2 bonus in this form), yet it will
be as light and handy to use as a dagger would be in the hands of the
same character. The weapon will actually penetrate wood or stone as
easily as if it were softer material when used by a gnome or halfling,
inflicting maximum damage against either substance.

Dagger of Throwing appears as a normal weapon, but will radiate a
strong dweomer when magic is checked for. The balance of this
sturdy blade is perfect, such that when it is thrown by anyone, the
dagger will demonstrate superb characteristics as a ranged weapon.
The magic of the dagger enables it to be hurled up to 6” distance
(shortlmedium range = 2”/4”)A.n y successful hit when it is thrown
will inflict twice normal dagger damage, plus the dweomer of the
blade, which will range from + 1 to + 4 (roll dl 00 and consult table below).
The experience-point value of a dagger of throwing is a base of
150, plus 100 points per magical plus. The gold piece sale value is
1,500 plus 1,000 gp per magical plus.
Dice Roll Magic Bonus

Hornblade is a magical weapon that originally appears as a sicklelike
blade resembling some sort of animal horn, ranging in size from
that of a knife to somewhat less than the length of a short sword. Even
a close visual and manual inspection is 90% unlikely to reveal it as
anything other than a piece of horn of VZ’ to 1%’ in length, set in
some sort of handle or grip. (If magic is detected for, a hornblade will
radiate a faint dweomer of the enchantment sort.) However, if the
proper pressure is applied in the correct place, a curved blade of
great strength and sharpness will spring out. The small versions
(knife-sized and dagger-sized) are usually enchanted to + 1 or + 2,
and the largest version (scimitar-sized) commonly has a bonus of + 2
or + 3. A hornblade of one of the smaller versions can be thrown, and
its bonus applies for both “to hit” and damage determination. A member
of any character class permitted to use sickle-like weapons may
use a hornblade. The magic of the weapon enables its possessor to
employ it as if it were a weapon of known type, providing that the possessor
has proficiency with a weapon in the appropriate category
(knife, dagger, or scimitar). The hornblade is retractable between
uses. The experience-point value and gold piece sale value of a
hornblade depend upon its size and the amount of its magical bonus:
Dice Result X.P. Value G.P. Value
01-20 Knife-sized, + 1 500 1,500
21-35 Knife-sized, + 2 1,000 3,000
36-50 Dagger-sized, + 1 750 2,000
51-70 Dagger-sized, + 2 1,500 4,000
71-90 Scimitar-sized, + 2 2,000 6,000
91-00 Scimitar-sized, + 3 3,000 9,000
Darts of Homing appear to be normal projectiles, but are actually
magic weapons of + 3 value. If magic is detected for, they will radiate
a dweomer of alteration and enchantment. If a dart of this nature hits
the target it is thrown at, it will magically return to the thrower in the
same round and can be re-used. A dart of homing does 4-9 points of
damage on a successful hit against any size of creature - a base figure
of 1-6 plus its magical bonus. If the dart misses its intended target,
it loses its dweomer. These weapons have twice the range of ordinary
darts - 3” short, 6“ medium, and 9” long.

Knife, Buckle is a magical blade having a hilt which exactly resembles
an ornament on a large belt buckle or a complete buckle of a
smaller sort. Its hilt can esaily be grasped and the weapon drawn from
its belt-sheath. The knife blade is short but has a very sharp point, so
that it inflicts damage just as does a larger knife. This weapon comes
in four varieties (roll d10):
Die Roll Type X.P. Value G.P. Sale Value
1 - 4 +1 100 1,000
5 - 7 +2 200 2,000
8 - 9 +3 300 3,000
10 +4 400 4,000

Quarterstaff, Magic appears to be a normal bronzewood staff shod
and banded with iron. The shaft is actually as strong as steel, and the
weapon has two magical qualities. Upon command the staff will alter
its length from as short as 6‘ to as long as 12’ (or any length in between).
lt inflicts damage as a quarterstaff (base amount of 1-6
points), with additions “to hit” and damage based upon its magical
bonus. The five varieties of magic quarterstaff are as follows:
Die Roll Type X.P. Value G.P. Sale Value
1 - 5 +1 250 1,500
6 - 9 +2 500 3,000
10 - 13 +3 750 4,500
14- 17 +4 1,000 6,000
18 - 20 +5 1,250 7,500

Scimitar of Speed is a magical weapon, usually of + 2 power, that enables
its wielder to always make the first attack in a melee round,
even though some magical effect might have otherwise slowed his or
her speed and reaction time. This initial attack will come in the first
segment of the round, ahead of any other action that may also take
place in that segment. The scimitar of speed also allows more than
one strike in some rounds; it increases the wielder’s figure for attacks
per melee round by one place, so that if 1 attack is normal, the improved
figure is 3/2, and if 3/2 is normal, then the improvement is to 2
attacks per round. This increase in attacks is cumulative with any
other bonus attacks (such as those provided by ahaste spell). The order
of attacks in the round is determined normally after the wielder of
the scimitar of speed has made his or her first attack to begin activity
in the round. It is possible, for instance, that a wielder entitled to 3 attacks
in the round will attack once before any other action takes
place, and then (because of poor initiative rolls or other factors) take
his or her remaining two attacks at the very end of the round. There
are versions of this weapon which are cutlasses, tulwars, and yatagans
(30% overall probability for a variant form, 10% chance for any
specific type). There is also a chance (25%) that the weapon will have
a bonus of something other than + 2; if this occurs, roll percentile dice
and refer to the following table to determine the appropriate bonus:
Dice Roll Type X.P. Value G.P. Sale Value
01 -50 +1 2,500 9,000
(normal form) +2 3,000 12,000
51 -75 +3 3,500 15,000
76 - 90 +4 4,000 18,000
91 -00 +5 4,500 21,000
