// Sun Blade swords are all of great size and must be treated as bastard swords. Their dweomer is such, however, that an individual possesing a sun blade may wield it as if it were a short sword with respect to encumbrance, weight, speed factor, and ease of use. In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and it inflicts damage as if it were a true sword of that sort, but the individual using a sun blade feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword. Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency or expertise will be able to use a sun blade. In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a +2 magic sword. Against evil creatures, its bonus is doubled to +4. When it is used against creatures from the Negative Material Plane or those that draw power from that plane (such as many of the undead), the sword will inflict double normal damage, regardless of whether the bonus of the weapon is + 2 or + 4. Furthermore, upon command, a sun blade can be swung vigorously through the air, and the blade will shed a bright yellow radiance which equals full daylight. The radiance will begin shining within a 10-foot radius around the sword-wielder and will spread outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, thus englobing an area of 60-foot radius. Thereafter, the radiance fades to a dim glow which persists for another 10 rounds before disappearing entirely. This sunray power of the blade can only be used once per day. All sun blades are of good alignment.
