ARMOR AND SHIELD (1II.F.)

As Dungeon Master you must be fully conversant with the armor gradation system. Because prior game forms worked from a high base number (9) upwards, I have opted to follow the same progression herein for the sake of continuity and familiarity. As a shield is the single common factor, it must be given a + 1 factor, i.e. be 1 class (5%) better than no armor, but listed before the diverse armor types, in order to allow its inclusion as a constant (without over-valuing it). For each + 1 of armor, regardless of the type of armor, the wearer moves upwards (toward or beyond AC 2 to 1 , 0, -1, -2, etc.). Thus, chain mail + 1 is chain mail (AC 5) 1 category better (AC 4), while a shield + 1 is equal to armor class 8 - or 2 places better than the armor worn by its inclusion, rather than but 1 (+1 for bearing shield, +1 for the magical bonus of the shield).

For game purposes all magical armor should be considered as being virtually weightless - equal to normal clothing, let us assume. This gives characters so clad a base movement speed equal to an unarmored man. Magic shields, however, weigh the same as a normal shield of the same size.

Armor of +3 bonus is of special meteorite iron steel, +4 is mithral alloyed steel, +5 is adamantite alloyed steel.

Special items are described below:

leather armor +1 is usable by those characters permitted to wear this
form of armor.

Plate Mail of Etherealness is seemingly normal +5 armor, but if a
command word is spoken, the suit enables its wearer and all non-living
items he or she wears and carries to become ethereal, just as if oil of
ethereolness (q.v.) had been used. While in the ethereal state the wearer
cannot attack material creatures. A phase door spell will negote the
ethereal state and prevent the armor from again so functioning for 1 day.
There are 20 charges placed upon plate moil of etherealness, and, once
used, they cannot be replaced or recharged. Furthermore, every 5 uses
reduces the class of the armor by 1, so if 5 charges ore used to become
ethereal the ormor is +4, if 10 are used it is +3, +2 if 15 are used, and
only + 1 if all 20 are exhausted.

Plate Mail of Vulnerability appears to every test to be magical + 1, +2, or
+3 armor, but it is actually -2, -3, or -4 cursed plate mail, whose great
vulnerability will not be apparent until on enemy successfully strikes a
blow in anger with desire and intent to kill its wearer. The ormor will fall to
pieces whenever an opponent strikes the weorer with on unmodified "to
hit" score of 20

Shield, large, + 1, +4 versus missiles is a typical large shield, but it is four
times more effective against hand hurled and mechanically propelled
missiles of all sorts. More importantly, the shield has a 20% chance of
negating rnogic missile attacks (from a frontal position, of course).
Shield -1, missile charcter not only makes the bearer equivalent to a
shieldless person, it also attracts missiles of all sorts to itself, so double or
treble the bearer's chances of being selected by random die rolling
according to the size of the party he or she is in. This cursed shield is not
distinguishable from a useful magical shield.

Note: If you are unfamiliar with medieval armor types, you might find
Charles ffoulkes' ARMOUR AND WEAPONS (Oxford 1909) a short and
useful text. The armor types I have selected are fitted into a gorne system.
Here is what they subsume: LEATHER ARMOR is cuir bouli, consisting of
coat, leggings, boots, and gauntlets. STUDDED LEATHER adds protective
plates set in the leather and an extra layer of protection at shoulder area.
RING MAIL is leather armor sewn with closely set iron rings. SCALE MAIL is
a suit of leather armor set with small overlapping iron plates. CHAIN MAIL
needs no explanation. BANDED MAIL is horizontal strips of articulated
armor plates worn over a suit of chain mail. SPLINT M A I L is a coot of
vertical plates of armor sandwiched within the layers of the garment and
worn over chain. PLATE MAIL is a set of pieces of plate (shoulder, breast,
bock, elbow, groin/hips legs) worn over chain mail. Plote ormor is a late
development and is not considered, i.e. the full suit of solid plate used c.
1500 is not an orrnor type used, but the reader should be aware that this
form of protection was lighter and more mobile than plate mail! It is also
two or three times more costly . .

ARMOR AND SHIELD (lll.F.2.)

Except where this obviously does not apply (such as for leather armor
+3), armor of +3 bonus is of special meteorite iron steel, +4 is
mithral alloyed steel, and + 5 is adamantite alloyed steel.
Special items from Table lll.F.2. are described below:

Anything Armor can be of any construction, from leather to plate. It
will originally appear as having a + 1 dweomer, but upon command it
will become any sort of other normal magical armor - one of the
types listed on the tables, and not necessarily of the same construction
as the anything armor in its unchanged form; Le., anything armor
that appears as leather can change into plate, or vice versa. However,
each such change is singular; the anything armor will never form into
a specific type of armor more than once. A change into a non-special
sort of armor will last for 1 day (24 hours) before the anything armor reverts
to its usual + 1 status. A change into some special-function type
of armor (such as plate mail of etherealness) will last but 1 hour. After
the possessor has commanded the anything armor to change three
different times, the armor will lose all of its magical properties.

Elfin Chain Mail is magical armor of a sort that is so fine and light that
it can be worn under normal clothing without revealing that it is there.
Because of its incredible lightness and flexibility, thieves can utilize it,
though it may slightly hinder their activities. However, it is rare for
such mail to be sized to fit anyone other than an elf or a half-elf. If a
suit of this mail is discovered, roll to ascertain what size of character it
will fit:
	Dice Roll Size of Elfin Chain
	01 - 10 gnomelhalfling (hairfoot)
	11 - 15 dwarflhalfling (stout or tallfellow)
	16 - 80 elflhalf-elf
	81 - 95 man-sized, normal (up to 6’, 200 Ibs.)
	96 - 00 man-sized, large (up to 6’/2‘, 250 Ibs.)

Plate Armor can be of the fieldplate or fullplate variety, as shown on
Table lll.F.2. In either case, the dweomer of the armor is such that it
will perfectly conform to the wearer’s physical dimensions, so long as
the wearer is of the race for which the armor was manufactured (i.e.,
any human can wear human-sized armor, any dwarf can wear dwarfsized,
etc.). In addition, magical plate armor can absorb more damage
than non-magical armor of the same sort. Fieldplate can absorb
an additional 10 points of damage per “plus” of the armor, and full
plate can absorb an additional 16 points per “plus.” Either type must
be repaired after absorbing its limit of damage, at the same costs in
money and time as for non-magical plate armor of the same sort (1
day and 100 gp per point of damage absorption for fieldplate, 2 days
and 200 gp per point for fullplate), but such repairs can only be made
by an armorer who is well versed in the creation and repair of magical
protection.
