Pyrotechnics (Alteration)

Level: 3	
Components: V, S, M
Range: 16"	
Casting Time: 5 segments
Duration: Special	
Saving Throw: None
Area of Effect: 10 or 100 times the fire source
Explanation/Description: A pyrotechnics spell can have either of two effects, It produces a flashing and fiery burst of glowing, colored aerial fireworks which lasts 1 segment per experience level of the druid casting the spell and temporarily blinds those creatures in the area of effect or under it or within 12" of the area (and in any event in unobstructed line of sight); or it causes a thick writhing stream of smoke to arise from the fire source of the spell and form a choking cloud which lasts for 1 round per experience level of the druid casting it, covering a roughly globular area from the ground or floor up (or conforming to the shape of a confined area), which totally obscures vision beyond 2'. The spell requires a fire of some sort in range. The area of pyrotechnics effect is 10 times the volume of the fire source with respect to fireworks, 100 times with respect to smoke. In either case, the fire source is immediately extinguished by the employment of the spell.

Pyrotechnics (Alteration)

Level: 2	
Components: V, S
Range: 12"	
Casting Time: 2 segments
Duration: Special	
Saving Throw: None
Area of Effect: 10 or 100 times the fire source used
Explanation/Description:	With she exception of she differences noted above, this spell is the same as the third level druid spell pyrotechnics 

Incendiary Cloud (Alteration-Evocation)

Level: 8	
Components: V, S, M
Range: 3"	
Casting Time: 2 segments
Duration: 4 rounds + 1-6 rounds	
Saving Throw: 1/2
Area of Effect: Special
Explanation/Description:	An incendiary cloud spell exactly resembles the smoke effects of a pyrotechnics spell (q.v.), except that its minimum dimensions area cloud of 10' height by 20' length and breadth. This dense vapor cloud billows forth, and on the 3rd round of its existence it begins to flame, causing 1/2 hit point per level of the magic-user who cast it. On the 4th round it does 1 hit point of damage per level of the caster, and on the 5th round it again drops to 1/2 h.p. of damage per level of the magic-user as its flames burn out. Any successive rounds of existence are simply harmless smoke which obscures vision within its confines. Creatures within the cloud need make only 1 saving throw if it is successful, but if they fail the first, they roll again on the 4th and 5th rounds (if necessary) to attempt to reduce damage sustained by one-half. In order to cast this spell the magic-user must have an available fire source (just as with a pyrotechnics spell), scrapings from beneath a dung pile, and a pinch of dust.
