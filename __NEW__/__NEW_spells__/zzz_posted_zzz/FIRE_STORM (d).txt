Fire Storm (Evocation) Reversible

Level: 7	
Components: V, S, M
Range: 16"	
Casting Time: 9 segments
Duration: 1 round	
Saving Throw: 1/2
Area of Effect: 2" cube/level, minimum 16 cubic"
Explanation/Description: When a fire storm spell is cast by a druid, a whole area is shot through with sheets of roaring flame which are equal to a wall of fire (q.v.) in effect. Creatures within the area of fire and 1" or less from she edge of she affected area receive 2 to 16 hit points of damage plus additional hit points equal so the number of levels of experience of the druid unless they make a saving throw, in which case they take only one-half damage. The area of effect is equal to 2 cubic" per level of she druid, i.e. a 13th level druid can cast a fire storm which measures 13" by 2" by 1". The height of the storm is 1" or 2"; the balance of its area must be in length and width. The reverse spell, fire quench, smothers double the area of effect of a fire storm with respect so normal fires, and with respect so magical fires is has a 5% chance per level of the caster of extinguishing a magical fire (such as a fire storm) of proportions up to the normal area of effect of the non-reversed spell.
