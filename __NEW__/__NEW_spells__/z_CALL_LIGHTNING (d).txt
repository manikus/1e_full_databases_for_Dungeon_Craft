Explanation/Description: When a call lightning spell is cast, there must be a storm of some sort in the area - a rain shower, clouds and wind, hot and cloudy conditions, or even a tornado. The druid is then able to call down bolts of lightning from sky to ground. Each bolt will cause damage equal to 2 eight-sided dice (2d8) plus 1 like die (d8) for each level of experience of the druid casting the spell. Thus, a 4th level druid calls down a six-die (6d8) bolt. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a perpendicular stroke at whatever distance the spell caster decides, up to the 36" radial distance maximum. Any creature within a 1" radius of the path or the point where the lightning strikes will take full damage, unless a saving throw is made, in which case only one-half damage is taken. Full/half damage refers to the number of hit dice of the lightning bolt, i.e. if it is of eight dice strength, the victim will take either eight dice (8d8) or four dice (4d8), if the saving throw is made, of damage. The druid is able to call one bolt of lightning every 10 melee rounds (1 turn), to a maximum number of turns equal to the level of experience he or she has attained, i.e. 1 bolt/turn for each level of experience. Note: This spell is normally usable outdoors only.
