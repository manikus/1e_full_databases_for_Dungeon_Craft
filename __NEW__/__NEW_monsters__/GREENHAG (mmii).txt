Greenhags are a race of evil creatures related to both annis and nighthags
(q.v.). As do the annis, greenhags dwell on the Prime Material
Plane. While many of these horrid creatures live in forests and lonely
moors, there are some inhabiting swamps and rivers. These latter sort
are often called shellycoats. The lair isalways a small cave, possiblyone
dug in earth. Greenhags of any sort attack by clawing with rock-hard
talons. They have strength of 18/00 and thus add +6 to the damage
inflicted by each such attack..
In order to lure victims to them, greenhags typically use their mimic
ability. This allows them to imitate the voice of a mature or immature
male or female, human or demihuman. Calls for help, crying, and so
forth are quite common deceptions employed by greenhags. They are
also able to mimic common animal sounds, such as those of barnyard
fowl, cats, dogs, goats, sheep and cattle.
Greenhags havethe following spell-like powerswhich they canemploy
1 at a time, at will, 1 per round: audibleglamer, dancinglights, invisibility,
pass without trace, change self, speak with monsters, water breathing,
weakness. Each power is employed at 9th level of ability.
Because of their coloration and the fact that they are 90% likely to be
able to move silently and hide in foliage (even of the underwater sort),
greenhags surprise 5 in 6 (19 in 20 if attacking from invisible state).
Because of their highly acute senses, including infra- and ultravision,
they are surprised only 1 in 20. Greenhaqsspeak their own language (a
dialect of Annis), Ogre, common Giant, and Common.
A typical greenhag appears to be a nighthag with green skin. Hair color
ranges from near black to olive green. Eye color ranges from amber to
orange. They often dress as peasants do.
